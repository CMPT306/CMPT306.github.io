      Lab 5: Brute Force - Convex Hull<br>
      <br>
    </h2>
    <p>This lab will involve implementing a brute force solution to the
      convex hull problem. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Begin with the following classes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="./ConvexHull.java">ConvexHull.java</a>
        - a collection of points, where a convex hull will be
        calculated. <b>This is the class you need to modify</b>.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="./Edge.java">Edge.java</a> - the edge
        between two points. This class calculates a line equation,
        distance, and the result of plugging in any point into the
        line's general line equation.<br>
        <br>
      </li>
      <li><a target="_blank" href="./ConvexHullGUI.java">ConvexHullGUI.java</a>
        - a GUI to make it easier to debug your program. This was
        adapated and modified from another GUI for this lab, so it's not
        the best example of coding. It invokes the necessary methods in
        the <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">ConvexHull</span></big>
        class.</li>
    </ul>
    <hr>
    <h4>Step 1. Download the three classes.</h4>

    <p>Examine the code, especially the <big><span style="font-family:
          monospace;">ConvexHull</span></big> and <big><span
          style="font-family: monospace;">Edge</span></big> classes. You
      will see a private <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">calculateConvexHull()</span></big>
      method at the end of the <big><span style="font-family:
          monospace;">ConvexHull</span></big> class that you need to
      complete. Also make sure you familiarize yourself with the
      existing methods in <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">ConvexHull</span></big>
      and <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">Edge</span></big>.</p>
    <p> It is important to notice the current <big><span
          style="font-family: monospace;">calculateConvexHull()</span></big>
      method does not work at all! It's only slightly better than a stub
      method. Try it out, and you'll see! </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h4>Step 2. Agree on pseudocode.</h4>
    <p>With your partner, review the convex hull problem and agree on
      pseudocode to calculate a convex hull using the brute force
      technique. </p>
    <p>This is an important step, because the algorithm has so many
      steps. <br>
    </p>
    <p> </p>
    <h4>Step 3. Code&nbsp; your solution.</h4>
    <p>Implement your algorithm. The <big><span style="font-family:
          monospace;">ConvexHullGUI</span></big> program will help you
      decide if your solution works.</p>
    <h4>Finish Early? Implement the Closest Points algorithm</h4>
    <p>The current closest points implementation in the <big><span
          style="font-family: monospace;">ConvexHull</span></big> class
      (the <big><span style="font-family: monospace;">getClosestPoints()</span></big>
      method) returns the first two points in the convex hull. Modify it
      so it correctly returns an array of the two closest points in the
      collection of points.</p>
    <p>Your changes should automatically appear in the <big><span
          style="font-family: monospace;">ConvexHullGUI</span></big>
      program. </p>

    <h3>Lab Demo</h3>
    When completed, either demo your lab to me or create a zip file of
    your three classes and submit it to the Lab 5 dropbox on Canvas.
