    </b><b>Homework #1</b><br>
    <br>
    <b>Due: By 11:59PM Wednesday September 6, 2017.<br>

    <b>Overview</b><br>
    <br>
    Two numbers are said to be <i>co-prime</i> if their only common
    factor is 1. For example, 4 and 9 are co-prime as their only common
    factor is 1. However, the numbers 4 and 10 are not co-prime.
    (Co-prime numbers are also referred to as <i>relatively prime</i>.)<br>
    <br>
    This assignment will involve writing a Python script that is passed
    two values M and N, and it will determine all the co-prime pairs
    between (1,1) and (M,N). It will present these co-primes by
    outputting them as a grid. For example, the following displays the
    co-prime pairs of of M = 15 N = 15<br>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
      <blockquote><img alt="" src="./coprimes.png" height="388"
          width="400"><br>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    where an asterisk represents a co-prime pair. The following image
    shows the relative positions of each pair (notice that (1,1) is the
    lower left-hand corner) where the blue circle is the co-prime pair
    (4,9), and the yellow circle indicates (4,10) is not co-prime.<br>

    <b>Assignment</b><br>
    <br>
    <b> Jupyter Notebook User</b><br>
    Download the following script as a starting point:  <a href="./CoPrime.ipynb">CoPrime.ipynb</a>. (Save Link As...)<br>
    Modify number1 and number 2 to test your code.
    <br><br>
    <b> Eclipse + PyDev User</b><br>
    Follow the instructions in this <a href="http://people.westminstercollege.edu/faculty/ggagne/software/">page</a> to install Eclipse and PyDev. <br>
    Write a Python script that is passed two parameters representing the
    pairs to generate. Download the following script as a starting point:  <a href="./CoPrime.py">CoPrime.py</a>. (Save Link As...)<br>
    It currently expects two parameters passed on the command line.<br>
    <br><br><br>
    This script provides a few helpful features. Notably, it declares
    result as a list of lists. The statement<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;<big><tt>&nbsp; result = [None] * (m + 1)</tt></big><br>
    <br>
    declares <big><tt>result</tt></big> as a list containing <big><tt>(m


        + 1)</tt></big> entries where each entry contains the value <big><tt>None</tt></big>
    (Python uses <big><tt>None</tt></big> to represent null.)<br>
    <br>
    The statements<br>
    <br>
    <blockquote><big><tt>for i in range (0, m+1):</tt></big><br>
      <big><tt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; result[i] = ['^'] * (n + 1)</tt></big><br>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    assigns each entry in <big><tt>result</tt></big> to be a list of
    size <big><tt>(n + 1)</tt></big> where each entry is a <big><tt>'^'</tt></big>
    character.<br>
    <br>
    The subsequent <big><tt>for</tt></big> loop displays the contents
    of <big><tt>result</tt></big>.<br>
    <br>
    Please design and implement an algorithm that displays the co-prime
    pairs from (1,1) to (m,n).<br>
    <br>
    <b>Submission</b><br>
    <br>
    Submit your implementation of <big><tt>CoPrime.py</tt></big> to
    Canvas by 11:59 PM on Wednesday, September 6, 2017.<br>
